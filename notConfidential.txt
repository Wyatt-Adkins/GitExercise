I enjoy this class so far, I've always loved coding and beeing able to trouble shoot with people and
learn together has been great. this is 100% more exciting then pouring over the BASIC programming
manual for the C64. its also far better than the classes i took in high school which boiled
down to "heres a piece of paper. copy this code into the editor. good job. you did it :) "
